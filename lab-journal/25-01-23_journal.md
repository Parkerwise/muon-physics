# Intentions
---

- to ensure that we are taking good data
- to start data collection
- working out theory and operation
- start fitting data, trying to get results

# Measurements
---
HV: -11.50 Volts
discriminator: 200 mV
Turned pulser off.

# Summary
---
We took data for about 2 hours. Although I doubt we will use this data because after looking into how the experiment works, it appears there is still some calibration that needs to be done. This has to do with the discriminator threshold. We looked into stuff wrt the discriminator threshold and data acquisition. I plan to use simulated to data to start data fitting and analysis so that when our data is ready we can use the same methods to determine muon decay rate.
